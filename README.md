This debloater is designed for a Samsung phone. I could only test my own (Samsung S20 FE).


With standard you will still have most apps such as Google, Samsung pass, Samsung Health. This type of selection is for debloating the phone by a bit. Reducing telemetry, but still for having a stable device.

"Standard Recommended" is a somewhat debloated android. All functions are still available, but most bloatware apps and packages are listed that are unnecessary.

"Standard All" is a more debloated Android. With this one there may be a possibility that some functions will not work, but all necessary functions and apps should still be working.


"Minimal" aims to debloat the phone even more. Its to remove all apps that Google, Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook forces to you. You might need an external device, to load apks on your phone.

"Minimal Recommended" contains package names that if uninstalled, will greatly reduce the resources of the phone. Many unnecessary apps will be gone, some functions might not work but the most necessary functions will work. This includes the packages for all browsers (install your own via an apk from USB).

"Minimal All" lists more packages that can be removed. If removed there is a bigger chance of it being more unstable rather than the recommended version.


"Custom" is a version that I personally use. I wanted to minimise everything, but still retain the functions that I need everyday. If you want you might wanna try it.
