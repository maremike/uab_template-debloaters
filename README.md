These debloater files were designed for a Samsung phone. I could only test it on my own (Samsung S20 FE).

To use it you have to download the listed file in the folder and put it inside the unzipped android sdk folder with the executable for the UAB (universal android debloater). If you do this and start the executable, you will have preselected packages. To remove them change the Tab "Recommended" to "All" and press "Uninstall".
\
\
With standard you will still have most apps such as Google, Samsung pass, Youtube, Samsung Health. This type of selection is for debloating the phone by a bit. Reducing telemetry, but still having a very stable device with all possible features. All functions are still available, but most bloatware apps and packages will be deleted.
\
\
"Minimal Recommended" aims to debloat the phone even more. Its to remove all apps that Google, Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook and etc. forces on you. You might need an external device, to load apks on your phone. This removes Samsung DEX, keeps SmartView (just in case), and removes many Knox features like Secure Folder (which is deprecated anyway, Android uses now Work profiles). It also takes a more radical approach removing the clock app, which means youd need to use an alternative. It still runs stable, as the necessary and "unnecessary" features are still available.
\
"Minimal Extended" contains package names that if uninstalled, will greatly reduce the resources of the phone. Many unnecessary apps will be gone, some functions might not work but the most necessary functions will work. This includes the packages for all browsers (install your own via an apk from USB). Samsung Location packages for example will be deleted, and therefore Samsung apps like Samsung health and camera would have a problem with it (camera wouldnt be able to put the location in each photo. Major security improvement). 
\
\
"Custom" is a version that I personally use. I wanted to minimise everything, but still retain the functions that I need everyday. If you want you might wanna try it. I dont need Accessibility, Samsung DEX, weather, samsung pay... And more. I download dialer, calculater, contacts, browsers, etc. that are open source. I still kept some Samsung apps, because they contain relevant code for alternatives in them (for example an external files app would not work without the Samsung Files app).

Important: Some packages might be region dependent. As Im from Germany, one package starts with "de". If a certain package is not found, it will simply be ignored. But the packages that are region dependent usually have something to do with SIM card, or Samsungs advertisement. I have not made selections in correlation to ISP packages. Which is not much. You dont have to search for unnecessary pacakges yourself.
