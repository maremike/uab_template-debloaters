These debloater files were designed for a Samsung phone. I could only test it on my own (Samsung S20 FE).
\
\
To use it you have to download the listed file in the folder and put it inside the unzipped android sdk folder with the executable for the UAB (universal android debloater). If you do this and start the executable, you will have preselected packages. To remove them change the Tab "Recommended" to "All" and press "Uninstall".
\
\
With standard you will still have most apps such as Google, Samsung pass, Samsung Health. This type of selection is for debloating the phone by a bit. Reducing telemetry, but still having a stable device. All functions are still available, but most bloatware apps and packages are listed that are unnecessary.
\
\
"Minimal" aims to debloat the phone even more. Its to remove all apps that Google, Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook and etc. forces on you. You might need an external device, to load apks on your phone.
\
"Minimal Recommended" contains package names that if uninstalled, will greatly reduce the resources of the phone. Many unnecessary apps will be gone, some functions might not work but the most necessary functions will work. This includes the packages for all browsers (install your own via an apk from USB).
\
"Minimal All" lists more packages that can be removed. If removed there is a bigger chance of it being more unstable rather than the recommended version.
\
\
"Custom" is a version that I personally use. I wanted to minimise everything, but still retain the functions that I need everyday. If you want you might wanna try it. I dont need Accessibility, Samsung DEX, weather, find my mobile and samsung pay. And more. I download dialer, calculater, contacts, browsers, etc. that are open source. I still kept some Samsung apps, because they contain relevant code for alternatives in them (for example an external calendar app would not work without the Samsung calendar).
